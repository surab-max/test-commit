## What Is This?

Canopy Network is not just another quest platform.

It’s a **behavior-based launch system** where your actions define your allocation — not just your wallet size.

---

## Why Loyalty Matters

In mature networks:

Capital is everywhere.
Real participation is rare.

Canopy rewards the second.

Every quest you complete signals:

✔ You are active
✔ You are consistent
✔ You are part of the ecosystem

---

## How You Earn

Complete quests → Gain **CNPY Loyalty Points**

Loyalty Points work alongside:

* Address reputation
* Interaction patterns
* Contribution signals

The system evaluates *how you participate*, not just *how much you hold*.

---

## The Strategy

Early users build history.
History builds trust.
Trust shapes allocation.

So stack loyalty now.
